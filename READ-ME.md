# Google-Chat-Webhooks-master
A bunch of Google Chat Webhooks.

# All of these are EXAMPLES!
Be free to take all of these!
I took these from the official Google Developer API and changed it up a bit.

# what do these all do?
Annoucement.py: Add's an "Annoucement:" prefix to the messages you send. (usually to annouce)
Send.py: Send's whatever you input into it. (usually to show that you are a bot)
Alphabet.py: Generates a letter from a-z. (usually to annoy)

# HALPP!!! IS NOT WORK!!!!!
Common Errors
1. Not installing the Google Chat imports. (pip install httplib2)
2. Forgetting to add the webhook ID.
3. Modifying or removing important parts of the code.
4. Not having Python 3.8 installed.
